# Oyster

Oyster keeps the user's AI work organised, synced and ready to share across
devices, with memory and publishing built in. The user brings whichever
agents they prefer — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, or any other
MCP-aware agent (including you, whichever agent you are) — and switches
anytime. **Oyster does not run the user's AI;
it keeps the work their agents make.**

It is NOT a chat interface or a file browser — it is a workspace surface where
artifacts (interactive documents, apps, diagrams, etc.) live alongside the
user's sessions and memories, organised by Space (project).

## "Set up Oyster for me" — first-run playbook

Oyster is for anyone whose work is organised as projects — developers, designers,
writers, PMs, researchers, hackers. Don't assume the user is a dev.

When the user asks you to set up Oyster / discover their projects / get them
started, YOU do the audit. Oyster does NOT have a server-side classifier; it
relies on your intelligence + your own tools (shell, file reads, git log, etc.)
to understand the user's filesystem and propose a set of spaces.

### Step 1 — Audit the filesystem (takes minutes, that's fine)

Probe common places where users keep work. Don't limit yourself to \`~/Dev\`.
Inspect each place with shell / ls / file reads. For each promising subfolder:

- Is there a \`.git\`? Run \`git -C <path> log -1 --format=%cs\` to see last-commit
  date — separates active from dormant.
- Is there a README, \`package.json\`, \`pyproject.toml\`, \`go.mod\`, etc.? Read
  it briefly to understand what the project actually is.
- Are there substantive files without code markers (\`.md\`, \`.docx\`, \`.fig\`,
  \`.key\`)? That's a non-code project — writing, design, PM work — still a
  project worth a space.
- Is it a vendored dependency, a third-party fork, or a library the user is
  tracking rather than actively developing? That's not a user-owned project;
  it belongs in "other" or flagged as an open question, not its own space.
- Is it noise (a cache dump, a worktree scratch dir, OS-default folders,
  app data like \`~/Documents/Zoom\`)? Filter out.

Probe list to start (Mac / Linux; substitute \`%USERPROFILE%\\\` on Windows):
\`~/Dev\`, \`~/dev\`, \`~/Development\`, \`~/code\`, \`~/repos\`, \`~/src\`,
\`~/Projects\`, \`~/projects\`, \`~/Work\`, \`~/work\`, \`~/workspace\`,
\`~/Documents/Projects\`, \`~/Documents/Work\`, \`~/Documents\`, \`~/Desktop\`,
\`~/Design\`, \`~/Figma\`, \`~/Writing\`, \`~/Notes\`.

Windows users: also check other drives — \`C:\\Development\`, \`E:\\Development\`,
\`D:\\Work\`, etc.

Don't exhaustively scan everything. Stop when you have a clear picture of the
user's active projects.

### Step 2 — Group intelligently

- Related things belong together: signals include a shared prefix or suffix
  in folder names, a monorepo structure, or a common theme.
- Unrelated odds and ends (single configs, third-party things the user doesn't
  own) can go in an \`other\` bucket if they matter, or be filtered as noise.
- Space names are short, lowercase, and human — pick whatever the user
  would actually call this part of their work.

### Step 3 — Send the proposal to the UI

Call \`propose_setup\` with your grouped spaces and an \`everythingElse\` array
for folders you considered but didn't auto-group. The user gets an interactive
panel where they can toggle, rename, drag chips, +Add space, and apply.

DO NOT write a markdown plan in chat. The panel IS the plan. After calling
\`propose_setup\`, briefly acknowledge in chat (one short sentence — e.g.
"Sent you a proposal — pick what looks right.") and stop. Do NOT call
\`onboard_space\` yourself; the user applies via the panel and the server
fans out the writes.

If you're unsure whether a folder is a real project, put it in
\`everythingElse\` rather than asking — the user can drag it into a space
themselves. No open questions in chat.

### Step 4 — Don't apply

You don't apply. The panel sends the user's confirmed selections to
\`POST /api/setup/apply\`, which calls \`onboard_space\` per space on your
behalf. The surface refreshes via SSE; the user sees it happen.

### If the user gave you an explicit path

(e.g. *"set up Oyster with my projects at ~/foo"*)

Skip the probe. Start at Step 1 for just that path — walk its subfolders,
apply the same judgement, then call \`propose_setup\` for the user to confirm.

### Don't silently drop anything

If you considered a folder and decided it wasn't a project, surface it in
\`everythingElse\` (the panel renders it as a draggable chip) rather than
omitting it. The user can ignore it or drag it into a space — that's their
call, not yours.

## "Here's my context from another AI" — import playbook

If the user pastes content that describes their spaces / projects / summaries /
memories — a dump they asked ChatGPT, Claude, or another tool to produce using
Oyster's import prompt — DON'T treat it as opaque text and DON'T ask what to do
with it. Extract the structure and apply.

The paste may be YAML, JSON, paraphrased Markdown, or a mix — don't rely on
strict parsing. Read the content, identify the three categories, and apply via
these tools:

- **Spaces / projects** → call \`onboard_space({ name })\` once per space.
  Paths are NOT required; spaces are logical groupings. Don't invent filesystem
  paths. If the user later points at real folders, attach them then.
- **Summaries** → call \`set_space_summary({ name, title, content })\` once per
  space summary in the paste.
- **Memories** → call \`remember({ content, tags, space })\` once per memory.
  Use the space name from the memory's \`space\` field; apply verbatim tags
  if present.

When done, confirm with a short "applied N spaces, M summaries, K memories" and
offer to attach filesystem paths to any of the spaces if the user wants them
connected to real folders on disk.

## Core concepts

**Artifacts** — the items on the desktop. Each artifact has:
- \`id\`: unique identifier (opaque for new artifacts, semantic for legacy ones)
- \`label\`: display name shown under the icon on the desktop
- \`kind\`: one of app | deck | diagram | map | notes | table | wireframe
- \`space\`: which workspace it belongs to (e.g. "home", or any space name the user set up)
- \`status\`: ready | online | offline | starting | generating
- \`url\`: how to open it (relative path for static files, localhost:PORT for running apps)
- \`group\`: optional visual group on the desktop surface

**Spaces** — named workspaces (tabs) the user switches between. Each space has an ID,
display name, and scan status. Use \`list_spaces\` to enumerate them. Every workspace
has a "home" space by default; the user adds others as they onboard projects. Spaces
are logical groupings — they can optionally have one or more folders attached. Use
\`onboard_space\` to create a space (with or without paths).

**Artifact kinds**:
- \`app\` — a local web app (React, Vite, etc.) that runs as a process on a port
- \`deck\` — a slide presentation (HTML/reveal.js)
- \`diagram\` — a visual diagram (Mermaid .mmd, draw.io, etc.)
- \`map\` — a mind map or spatial layout
- \`notes\` — markdown notes or README
- \`table\` — a spreadsheet or data table (HTML)
- \`wireframe\` — a UI wireframe or mockup

**Runtime kinds**:
- \`static_file\` — served directly from disk (most documents, HTML, MD, Mermaid)
- \`local_process\` — spawned as a child process; status tracks whether the port is open
- \`redirect\` — an external URL

## What agents should do

**Onboarding a single project:**
1. Call \`list_spaces\` — check if the space already exists (avoid duplicates).
2. Call \`onboard_space\` with the project name and path — pass \`paths: ["/abs/path"]\` (array). Creates the space and attaches the path as a project.
3. Call \`gather_repo_context\` to read the repo's key files and get deterministic artifact suggestions — useful before generating summaries or creating new artifacts from repo content.

**Onboarding a developer container (e.g. \`~/Dev\` with many repos):**

Don't loop \`onboard_space\` once per folder. Group related projects first (shared prefix / suffix / clear theme), then call \`onboard_space({ name: "oyster", paths: [path1, path2, path3] })\` — one call per grouped space, with every related folder in the \`paths\` array.

See the "Set up Oyster for me" playbook above for the full audit + propose + apply flow.

**Working with artifacts:**
- Use \`create_artifact\` to write a new file and register it in one step.
- After \`create_artifact\`, always call \`reveal_artifact\` with the new artifact's id — this switches the user's desktop to the right space and highlights the icon so they know where it landed.
- Use \`read_artifact\` to read the content of an existing static file artifact.
- Use \`update_artifact\` to rename, change the kind, or change the group. Space is derived from the artifact's project and cannot be reassigned here.
- Use \`remove_artifact\` to archive an artifact (hide from surface, reversible). The file and record are preserved and accessible via the archived view.

**Archived / removed artifacts:**
- Archived artifacts don't appear in the default \`list_artifacts\` results. Use \`list_archived_artifacts\` to see what's been removed.
- Use \`restore_artifact\` to bring one back to the live surface.
- The user can also browse their archived items via the archive icon at the bottom-left of the desktop, or the \`#archived\` space pill.

Do NOT read or write the SQLite databases under Oyster's \`db/\` folder directly.

Create user content via \`create_artifact\` — it writes under \`${userlandDir}/spaces/<space-id>/\` automatically. Do not write directly into \`${userlandDir}/db/\`, \`${userlandDir}/backups/\`, or treat the workspace root as a general write location; \`apps/\` is reserved for installed app bundles.
